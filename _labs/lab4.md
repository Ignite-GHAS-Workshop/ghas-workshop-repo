# Lab 4 - Hands-on with Dependency Review

With Dependency Review enabled and configured, we want to block vulnerable packages from entering the codebase. We can define a repository ruleset to enforce this as well!

## Exercise 1: Add the Dependency Review Action

First, let's add the dependency review action workflow.

1. In the repository, click on the **Actions** tab.
2. Click on the **New workflow** button in the upper left.
3. Search for "**dependency**" and click enter on your keyboard.
4. Under the **Dependency Review** workflow, click **Configure**.
5. Review the action and its defaults on line 32-39. This action can also block specific open source license types.
6. In the upper right, click on **Commit changes...**
7. Since we have a ruleset, we have to create a branch and merge this to main via pull request. Create a branch and commit (**propose**) the changes.
8. On the next screen, use the Copilot icon to generate a pull request description. Use either outline or summary.
9. **Create pull request**.
10. Wait for the code scanning job to finish. It will take a few minutes to run.
11. Merge the PR in when it completes.
12. Navigate to **Settings** of the repo.
13. Navigate to **Rules --> Rulesets** again to modify the existing ruleset you created in lab 3.
14. Under the **Require status checks to pass**, click on the **Show additional settings** button.
15. Click on **Add checks**.
16. Search for `dependency-review` and add it (it should show up under **suggestions**).
17. Save the ruleset.

## Exercise 2: Introduce a dependency vulnerability

Now, let's attempt to add a vulnerable dependency to the codebase and test out the dependency review feature.

1. In the repository, switch to the `lab4/dependency-vulnerability` branch.
    - You can change to this branch by selecting the **main** dropdown below the repository name when under the **Code** tab.
2. Open up the `package.json` file in the repository root.
3. Navigate to line 181 and review this line - this branch has a change to introduce the `"tar": "2.2.2"` package to the codebase - a package with a known vulnerability.
4. Create a pull request by navigating the the **Pull requests** tab and clicking on the **New pull request** button.
5. Make sure to select the `lab4/dependency-vulnerability` branch to merge into the `main` branch.
6. Wait for the dependency review job to finish.
7. It should make a comment to the pull request with a note that it found a vulnerable package dependency. In fact, adding this one vulnerable package would introduce 3 new vulnerabilities to our codebase.
8. Also, the status check will be marked as failed, preventing the pull request from being merged.

## Summary

Celebrate ðŸŽ‰! We just prevented a security vulnerability from entering our codebase! Without dependency review, if a pull request from this branch was opened to main, nothing would prevent the vulnerability from being introduced.

In the next lab, we are going to go hands-on with secret scanning, and see how we can use push protection to stop secrets from being pushed to GitHub.
